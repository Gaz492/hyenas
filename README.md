**Hyenas is the world's first homemade PlayStation®Network emulator for the PS3®**. Look at the `www` (public server directory) folder for files. This project is made for the Javascript programming language running on Node.js.

## Features

- ✓ Authentication that would allow you to play games online ultra fast and mega securely.
- ✓ Get past the sign-in prompt when playing games online (mocked ticket authentication).
- ✓ Completely isolated from the actual servers, which means console-bans are a non-issue.
- ✓ Guaranteed to be able to play the games you've played as a kid (with your future children.)
- ✕ The PlayStation®Store, PlayStation®Plus, PlayStation®Now, PlayStation®TV, CrossPlay, etc…
