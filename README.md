The world's first homemade, open-source PlayStation®Network emulator. Look at the `www` (public server directory) folder for documentation about the server and files. This project is made for the PHP7+ programming language running on Apache 2.4+.

I did NOT create "PlayStation®Network" nor am I affiliated with any company, subsidiary, party, partner, affiliate, and any licensed licensor, licensee, publisher, developer, merchant, or vendor. This project has been specially crafted to avoid any copyright infringement and even avoids the use of the service name when possible. I am not responsible or liable for any dispute you may have with any entity over this project. This was created for the cause of preservation — for future generations of players to be able to play a more than a decade-old video game system online that has its game servers shutting down and possibly the whole network that is *required* to play any game online. Nothing malicious is intended. **To Sony**: If you're reading this, don't be cold and actually talk to me by email informally before filing any C&D notice against me. That would be great.
